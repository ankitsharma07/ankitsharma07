*"Man's greatest asset is the unsettled mind." ~ Isaac Asimov*

I am currently working as an Machine Learning Engineer.

I am passionate about Machine Learning and advancement in the field of Natural Language Processing and LLMs. In my free time I wander around open source codebases and develop on Apple Platforms.

🤔 **Emacs** is my favorite editor. Best for everything that is there.
